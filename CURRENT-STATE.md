# Vellistry — current verified state

## Verified baseline and active work

FACT: checked main is `23fd8488df060e1591be70232abd70f4255e814d`, after PR #106.
[Post-main CI39868833625](https://github.com/Ben-001-sys/Vellistry/actions/runs/39868833625)
passed governance, application/security and PostgreSQL CAS/restore. Integrated SQL
privilege regression was SKIPPED because its proposed fixture is absent; no SQL
acceptance follows. Re-fetch main and open PRs before each new task; this is a dated
verified baseline, not a claim that a document can embed its own future commit.

Task0041/PR106 is integrated; original PR #83 was closed only after its successor’s
post-main PASS. Its [immutable CP0041](docs/agent-workflow/context-packs/VEL-CP-0041.md)
and historical evidence remain unchanged. PR #65, PR #68, PR #59, PR #66 and PR #82
are closed with source-preserving dispositions. Issues69/72/79 are closed for
repository delivery;18/63/67/74 retain external acceptance requirements.

Task0042 completed bounded420-pin recovery. Its clean restore found new Next16.4.0
security advisories, so [Task0043/CP0043](docs/agent-workflow/context-packs/VEL-CP-0043.md)
was pinned before the minimal16.4.1 dependency patch. Audit now reports zero findings;
23preflight/67Library tests, build/typecheck and patched offline restore passed.
The final [remediation report](docs/reports/VEL-REMEDIATION-COMPLETION-0042.md) and its
successor integration remain IN_VERIFICATION until actual final review, ready CI,
merge and post-main success. Candidate ledger:35DONE,5PARTIAL,4BLOCKED, never44DONE.

Use the [44-item ledger](docs/reports/VEL-MASTER-REMEDIATION-LEDGER.md),
[PR/source dispositions](docs/reports/VEL-CURRENT-TRUTH-0041-DISPOSITIONS.md) and
[149-ID observed evidence overlay](docs/reports/VEL-CURRENT-TRUTH-0041-FEATURES.md).
Earlier dated claims are retained in the [previous snapshot](docs/reports/CURRENT-STATE-ARCHIVE-2026-10-22.md),
not current dispatch instructions.

## Implementation and evidence

The Next.js/NestJS/Supabase foundation and author-isolated Book Library are merged.
Current regression coverage includes67 Library and23 preflight cases; synthetic
Auth/RLS/logout and PostgreSQL CAS/restore run in disposable CI environments.
These do not establish hosted persistence or complete the149 planned feature tests.
IMP-002, IMP-003A and IMP-003B are NOT_STARTED under this remediation mandate.
The accepted Tiptap3/ProseMirror direction does not mean a production editor exists.

[PR68 reconciliation](docs/reports/VEL-PR68-RECONCILIATION-0039.md) records all38
original paths and22 successful historical reruns at pinned sources. Original
zero-step infrastructure failures remain historical evidence. No billing repair
mechanism or savings is inferred. PR104 merged with post-main39661737567 SUCCESS.

[Source preservation](docs/reports/VEL-SOURCE-PRESERVATION-0038.md) retains the exact
original transport ZIP and SRC-001–SRC-003 hashes. SRC-004 remains missing; summaries
are not its original. [Source register](docs/research/SOURCE-REGISTER.md) is canonical.
[Level B evaluation](docs/agent-workflow/handoff-evaluations/VEL-HO-0004.md) has ten
technical PASS results and unset owner acceptance. Task0038 fresh code generation
is verified, but independent filesystem execution was blocked. Neither result
completes checklist item27's end-to-end implementation requirement.

## Effective authority and security holds

Default roles remain ChatGPT coordinator/reviewer, Codex implementer and owner
scope/acceptance authority under [ADR0008](docs/decisions/ADR-0008-codex-primary-agentic-implementation-workflow.md).
The [one-time owner delegation](docs/agent-workflow/authorizations/VEL-REM-INTEGRATION-20261019.yaml)
authorizes only this unfinished remediation's eligible repository integrations and
supersessions after distinct trusted review and actual CI. It does not authorize
future features or waive security gates, and ends at completion/formal closure.
Owner declined CodeRabbit: use existing trusted Codex review channels.

G_DESIGN and G_CODE remain pending broad gates; explicit bounded task exceptions
do not promote them. G_PRIVATE_PILOT and G_RELEASE remain unapproved. Branch
protection was explicitly deferred by the sole maintainer; no setting change or
technical prevention of a malicious authorized writer is claimed.

Hosted Supabase access (including read-only), CLI authentication, migration execution,
Auth users, real private manuscripts, production deployment and paid operations
remain separately controlled. Third SQL definition is planning-only, not adopted
into the operative migration tree. [Exact decision packet](docs/reports/VEL-PR68-RECONCILIATION-0039-DECISION-PACKET.md)
separates repository SQL adoption, target inventory, authentication/dry run, migration,
fixtures, signed-out JWT/direct Data API mitigation and release. Hosted acceptance is
BLOCKED/NOT_RUN. An unexpired signed-out JWT remains a private-pilot security blocker.

## Next permitted work and readiness

Finish only Task0044’s final exact-head review/integration/CI attestation. No new
feature implementation is dispatched. The [conditional closure record](docs/agent-workflow/authorizations/VEL-REM-INTEGRATION-20261019-CLOSURE.md)
ends the one-time delegation automatically after final post-main PASS and the exact
PR/Issue71 attestation. Thereafter ordinary owner-authorized Task/ContextPack,
review and merge governance applies; no further authority carries to features.

Continued local implementation: conditional GO after those final gates and a new
bounded owner-authorized task. Hosted acceptance: NO-GO pending separate permissions
and evidence. Private-author pilot: NO-GO. Production release: NO-GO.
Original SRC004, independent end-to-end execution, historical LevelB owner acceptance,
SQL adoption/hosted security and unavailable cost comparison remain explicit blockers.

## Retained product decision references

[Owner waves01–03 selections](docs/history/2026-10-10-owner-waves-01-03-recommendations-accepted.md),
[HIS-20261010-003 writer-owned free-or-paid BYOK clarification](docs/history/2026-10-10-owner-byok-free-or-paid-clarification.md)
and [bounded design-entry delegation](docs/history/2026-10-10-owner-delegated-mvp-design-entry.md)
retain their original scopes. They do not authorize paid calls, feature execution,
private manuscripts or deployment under this remediation mandate.

[Task0044/immutable CP0044](docs/agent-workflow/context-packs/VEL-CP-0044.md) selectively integrates the exact Task0042/0043 sources after a fresh current-main pack. Original source branch and historical packs remain preserved; no compliance rule is changed.
