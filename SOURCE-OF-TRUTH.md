# Source of Truth and Knowledge Ownership

## Engineering authority
- **Git repository:** canonical engineering documents, code, accepted project decisions, research evidence references, specifications, and change history.
- **CURRENT-STATE.md:** compact, current working status; not a substitute for full evidence.
- **ADRs:** accepted or proposed technical and knowledge-governance decisions, with rationale, alternatives, approval and supersession lineage.
- **Source register:** where original research came from and where an immutable/retrievable copy can be found.
- **Feature inventory:** [docs/features/FEATURE-INVENTORY.md](docs/features/FEATURE-INVENTORY.md) is the reviewable index of discussed feature candidates and source/status links. **It is not an accepted product backlog, release plan, substitute for original source evidence, or approval of proposed features.**
- **Git history and pull requests:** revision provenance; do not substitute automatically for semantic record metadata.
- **ChatGPT and other agents:** analysis and proposal tools, not an independent source of architectural authority.

## Separate runtime authority
Future authors' manuscripts, story canon, application settings, credentials, and stored assets belong in purpose-selected runtime storage, not automatically in the Git engineering knowledge base. The accepted Next.js/NestJS/Supabase baseline is recorded in ADR-0006; the owner subsequently selected Supabase Cloud for development. This is not production hosting or real-manuscript approval; no live database state is inferred from old records.

## Five knowledge layers
1. Authoritative accepted project and implementation knowledge.
2. Current verified implementation/research state.
3. Historical rationale, experiments, rejected/superseded alternatives.
4. Temporary task-local agent context and unapproved hypotheses.
5. Evidence, provenance, authorship, validity, confidence, and traceability.

## Read → Propose → Review → Commit
1. Read the relevant accepted records and source citations.
2. Clearly label new assumptions, findings, recommendations, and uncertainties.
3. Review source fidelity and factual verification independently.
4. Promote material changes only after owner approval; update linked records and current state.
5. When superseding an ADR, preserve the older file and connect both sides of the lineage.

## PR review and sole owner authority
At present the project has a single human contributor. The owner performs self-review and makes the final merge/acceptance decision. A distinct human PR approval is not required. Automated CI and optional AI-agent reviews provide evidence and feedback; agents do not have approval authority. For significant changes, document the owner's review and decision in the PR or associated provenance record. GitHub does not count self-review as a separate approving reviewer; this workflow must not assume otherwise. If branch-protection settings require other human approvals, review the protection policy rather than fabricate reviewers. See HIS-20261008-002.

## Metadata and history
See [docs/governance/RECORD-SCHEMAS.md](docs/governance/RECORD-SCHEMAS.md). All ADR and historical-event records require YAML front matter and meaningful content.

## No silent conflation
The terms *verified evidence*, *accepted requirement*, *approved decision*, *implemented*, and *tested* are different. Never mark one as another without supporting evidence.

## Current task authority and provenance

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [ADR-0008](docs/decisions/ADR-0008-codex-primary-agentic-implementation-workflow.md)
express the owner-selected execution roles: ChatGPT coordinates and reviews;
Codex implements authorized bounded tasks; the owner alone approves consequential
scope, adoption and merge. Coordinator write access is not coding permission.
Lightweight triage/indexing/review does not grant authority to change effective
instructions or executable behavior. Any alternate implementer requires an
explicit owner task exception. Git commit author names do not prove runtime identity.

Use the compact [current checkpoint](CURRENT-STATE.md); its dated historical
archive is evidence, not active dispatch. Original source gaps remain gaps.
PR66's prior ChatGPT records are adopted with per-file source SHA attribution,
not relabeled Codex execution. This reconciliation proposes no semantic change
to accepted architecture or owner authority.
