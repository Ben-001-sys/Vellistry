# LANGUAGE.md — Vellistry product language and terminology

> **Adoption status:** Complete, implementation-ready **proposed language contract**, not an already approved owner decision. On explicit owner approval and repository integration, the `APPROVED_CONCEPT` terms below express already approved product meaning, and owner-approved `PROPOSED_LABEL` entries become the effective UI vocabulary. Before approval, do not retroactively relabel proposals as accepted or silently update application code. The file may guide reviews as a candidate immediately, but its presence alone does not change product scope, technical contracts, or owner authorization.

## 0. Quick reference for product designers, writers, and coding agents

1. **The author is in control.** Do not imply the application or AI independently authors, accepts, publishes, or establishes story truth.
2. **Use familiar writing words.** Prefer **book**, **chapter**, **manuscript**, **character**, **story thread**, and **writing rule** in general explanations; reserve **Story Profiles** and **Rules Studio** for the named Vellistry surfaces.
3. **Never collapse these boundaries:** manuscript / outline / notes; draft / saved revision; AI suggestion / accepted prose; suggested fact / approved story fact; AI prose acceptance / fact approval; local recovery / confirmed online save; exported document / full book backup.
4. **Actions name their effect:** **Create book**, **Add chapter**, **Continue writing**, **Rewrite selection**, **Accept suggestion**, **Reject suggestion**, **Approve fact**, **Dismiss suggestion**, **Download manuscript**, **Download book backup**, **Sign out**. Display-name choices identified as `PROPOSED_LABEL` need owner review before deployment.
5. **Status is evidence, not decoration.** Never display **Saved** without a server durability acknowledgement or **Saved on this device** without confirmed local persistence. A lost acknowledgement is **Save status unknown**, not necessarily **Save failed** or **Conflict**.
6. **AI is optional.** Never require an AI key for ordinary book writing, manual Story Profiles, rule editing, or supported export. Do not imply AI is free or that Vellistry pays provider bills.
7. **Current shipping boundary:** live implementation is login and a basic book library. Described chapter/editor/rules/AI UI is mainly approved product scope plus proposed UX, not verified deployed behavior.
8. **No silent renaming of technology:** labels here do not authorize changes to routes, SQL columns, RPCs, auth tokens, IDs, model/provider routing, source guidance files, or migration history.
9. **On an undefined or disputed term:** reuse a known semantic term where it fits exactly; otherwise add a proposed entry and request the owner's decision. Never invent another competing name.
10. **Check the exact affected screen and state** before using an example from this document. Example copy is a template conditioned on the specified behavior, never evidence that a feature works.

## 1. Purpose, authority, and applicability

### 1.1 What this file governs

This standard covers visible navigation, feature and page names, menus, breadcrumbs, tab names, buttons, form fields, helper text, tooltips, search and filters, confirmation dialogs, errors, empty states, saving and AI progress, notices, accessibility names, onboarding, author-visible revision provenance, export and privacy language, and future localized content. It also defines the semantic boundaries agents must preserve when writing content.

It **does not** standardize TypeScript/Python style, rename internal API or database artifacts, choose visual styling, decide new backend behaviors, authorize subscriptions, certify third-party rights, or approve extra MVP features. UI wording must follow tested behavior and accessibility requirements.

### 1.2 Authority and precedence

Apply authority in this order:

1. Explicitly owner-approved product scope, owner decisions, `PROJECT-CONSTITUTION.md`, accepted ADRs and security/privacy boundaries.
2. Verified code, real integration results and actual enabled features for truthful behavioral claims. Code does not automatically overrule the approved product goal; discrepancies are recorded as implementation gaps.
3. Once approved: **this document** for visible words that do not conflict with levels 1–2; source-of-truth change control applies.
4. Dated user-journey and design specifications (`VEL-JRN-001..011`, PLAN-03, editable Figma master) where not superseded; they are not all accepted routes/copy.
5. Competitor terminology, style guides and analyst proposals as supporting research, not independent authority.

Consult `CURRENT-STATE.md` and live GitHub status before claiming something is integrated or complete. Do not treat a proposed Figma route, a synthetic demonstration, or a historical PR as a production capability. The exact repository snapshot used to prepare this candidate is `f371448` on 2026-10-16; re-audit when adopting.

### 1.3 Status codes for this vocabulary

| Code | Interpretation | Implementation rule |
|---|---|---|
| `EXISTING_UI` | Exact or near-exact string verified in `main` application code | Preserve unless independently reviewed; it may still need refinement |
| `APPROVED_CONCEPT` | The named behavior/concept is supported by owner-approved scope, ADR, or later decision | Preserve meaning; suggested exact title-case/display capitalization may still be proposed |
| `PROPOSED_LABEL` | Recommended visible wording informed by evidence | Candidate to adopt; **not** pre-approved merely because listed here |
| `FUTURE_RESERVED` | Useful name for an explicitly deferred feature, not an MVP menu item | No enabled UI, marketing claim, or new scope without separate approval |
| `PENDING_DECISION` | Name or semantic mapping unresolved or dependent on unverified behavior | Do not enforce as final or show as enabled without review |
| `INTERNAL_ONLY` | Engineering/process name, not a suitable general UI label | May remain unchanged in code, data, logs and engineering docs |

Use `status` **per term** and, for high-impact changes, **per specific UI label**. A product concept's approval does not make every draft string official.

## 15. Agent instructions and integration rules

### 15.1 Mandatory pre-change checklist

For any task touching navigation, visible copy, UI states, status mapping, onboarding, accessibility text, dialogs, toasts, emails, files named for users or provider-consent wording:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT-CONSTITUTION.md`, `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`, current `CURRENT-STATE.md`, the affected accepted scope/spec/ADR, and this document's relevant sections.
2. Identify whether the feature is `EXISTING_UI`, approved but not implemented, proposed or deferred. Inspect actual component/source and API/error/DB state semantics **before** choosing words.
3. Reuse preferred terms precisely; determine whether this is the same concept, a contextual abbreviation or a distinct domain object.
4. Build a small copy mapping: surface/path, existing copy, proposed copy, semantic condition, expected action/result, accessibility name, associated test.
5. Flag unknown terminology or conflict as `PENDING_DECISION`; do not rewrite product names, owner decisions, immutable fiction-guidance records or technical schemas independently.
6. If wording implies a behavioral guarantee, identify the test/receipt/authorization evidence. If unverified, use qualified truthful wording or block the claim.
7. Implement only within an owner-authorized coding task and existing Codex ContextPack/ExecutionBundle workflow. **This document does not authorize implementation.**
8. Include copy and state coverage in tests and review evidence; update this record through separate owner-reviewed change control when adopting a new canonical term.

### 15.2 Do not change without explicit approval

- Approved M1–M8 scope, eleven journey IDs, the selected AI boundary and BYOK semantics.
- Product name/trademark claims, major module names such as **Rules Studio** and **Story Profiles**, or default source-language content that would alter authored rules.
- R01 compact/expanded frozen sources, their provenance IDs and owner mapping decisions.
- Internal SQL/table/column names (`owner_id`, `accepted_document`, `chapter_revisions`), API routes (`/v1/books`), typed enums/response codes (`acknowledgment_unknown`, `session_changed`), TypeScript symbols, provider names, contractual record IDs, or migration history **solely to align with UI labels**.
- Security, deletion, retention, cost, consent, export fidelity or save guarantees without appropriate verified implementation and owner approval.
- An unimplemented future feature's navigation/CTA as if it worked.

### 15.3 Enforcement and automated checks

Human review is primary for semantics; regex cannot decide whether **Accept** and **Approve** mean the same thing in a new context. Pragmatic checks, when separately authorized, can:

- inventory literals in `apps/web/src` (JSX text, attributes, `aria-label`, errors and constants) and compare against this vocabulary;
- flag known high-risk display phrases (`Saved` without receipt context; `Save failed` on unknown ACK; `Canon updated` before approval; `free AI` with no verified basis);
- test consent disclosure and actual transmitted context, including disabled rule exclusion;
- test exact sign-in/library/empty/error states, retry uncertainty and duplicate risk;
- test AI suggestion accept/reject/stale behavior and fact approval independence;
- test export/backup and destructive confirmation distinctions;
- run keyboard/screen-reader checks alongside visual copy checks.

Do not automatically replace all instances of “create”, “accept”, “version”, “story”, “rule” or “save”: many contextual uses are legitimate. A string-check suite cannot replace evidence of underlying authorization and data durability. Any new enforcement job must follow the project's CI/task governance and owner authorization.

### 15.4 Exact `AGENTS.md` insertion candidate

Originally proposed for insertion after `## Read in order` and before the operational workflow. **PR #77 now includes this snippet in `AGENTS.md` on its review branch; it is not yet merged into `main`.** This integration does not approve proposed product labels or alter existing owner/Codex authority.

```markdown
## Product language and UX copy (LANGUAGE.md)

- Before any change to user-facing navigation, page names, buttons, forms, dialogs, status messages, errors, tooltips, accessibility labels, onboarding, AI consent or export wording, read root `LANGUAGE.md` alongside the relevant accepted product requirements and current implementation.
- Follow `LANGUAGE.md` for owner-approved product terminology. Reuse canonical names consistently while allowing explicitly documented contextual short labels; preserve distinct concepts such as manuscript vs notes, AI suggestion vs accepted revision, suggested fact vs approved canon, and local recovery vs confirmed save.
- Verify what the interface and backend actually do before using success, save, privacy, cost, cancellation, deletion or provider-availability claims. Do not expose internal transport codes as author-facing text or mark proposed/future features as implemented.
- If a needed term is absent, proposed, disputed or inconsistent with approved scope, record the current wording, candidate, affected surfaces and supporting evidence for owner review. Do not silently make a new canonical decision or rename unrelated concepts.
- `LANGUAGE.md` governs visible words, not database fields, API routes, internal identifiers, source archives, accepted ADRs, or integration contracts. Do not change those solely to match display labels.
- Include user-facing copy/state checks and relevant accessibility/negative tests in the task ExecutionBundle. Do not change the language contract or add automation enforcing it outside the owner-authorized Task → ContextPack → implementation → review workflow.
```

## 16. Maintenance, approval and change control

### 16.1 Adoption

`LANGUAGE.md` currently has **proposed-owner-review** status. For it to become an effective source of truth: project owner reviews all `PENDING_DECISION` high-impact questions and accepts the vocabulary scope; implementation agent integrates document through an authorized task/PR as required by `AGENTS.md`; owner approves any updates to `AGENTS.md`; actual merged-main SHA and current state are reconciled. An unmerged local download or an AI-generated draft is not owner acceptance.

### 16.2 Introducing or revising a term

For each requested new/revised canonical term, capture:

| Field | Record |
|---|---|
| Term ID | Stable `VEL-LANG-TERM-###` or review ID, assigned during adoption |
| Concept and definition | Exact entity/action/state and its differences from adjacent terms |
| Proposed UI wording | Full, short and contextual labels; forbidden confusion |
| Classification | `EXISTING_UI`, `APPROVED_CONCEPT`, `PROPOSED_LABEL`, `PENDING_DECISION`, `FUTURE_RESERVED` |
| Affected surfaces | UI paths, components, errors, docs, tests, accessibility names |
| Evidence | Accepted scope/ADR, actual code, journeys, research and relevant source lines |
| Decision | Owner approval/rejection/date/PR/commit; not implicit |
| Transition | Where old label remains valid, replacement plan, old links/help compatibility |
| Validation | Manual task + automated/accessible copy checks and verified states |

Update terms through a reviewed versioned document change. Record superseded terms; do not simply erase historical source and variant identity. Maintain a small change log below as decisions occur.

### 16.3 Release and review checklist

- [ ] All enabled controls correspond to implemented behaviors; no phantom links.
- [ ] Same concepts have the same primary name; differences are intentionally contextual.
- [ ] Book / chapter / scene / notes / manuscript / series semantics preserved.
- [ ] AI suggestion acceptance and story-fact approval cannot be mistaken for each other.
- [ ] Local drafts, server save, unknown acknowledgement and true conflict have distinct messages.
- [ ] No unreviewed rule source collision or false default-pack completeness claim.
- [ ] No implied mandatory AI/provider spend or secret-persistence claim.
- [ ] Forms have explicit labels, useful validation and accessible error feedback.
- [ ] Deletion, export, backup, recovery and Undo explain actual effects and limits.
- [ ] Terms match visible routes and tested state transitions; pending/future items are not shipped as live.
- [ ] Any proposed canonical changes have owner decision and traceability.
