# Vellistry — Agentic Coding Remediation Checklist

44 items. Item 44 is a critical new control added after the coordinator-role breach; items 1–43 preserve the original checklist wording and numbering.

[ ] 01. Restore GitHub Actions execution
   Resolve the account payment/spending-limit restriction reported in PR #68's execution evidence. Rerun the failed workflows at their exact commit SHAs; do not classify runner-start failures as code-test failures.

[ ] 02. Complete the Codex-primary governance transition
   Review and integrate ADR-0008 in PR #66 after applicable verification. Ensure the effective default workflow is ChatGPT coordinator → Codex implementer → independent review → owner approval, with Cursor retained as an optional alternate.

[ ] 03. Resolve competing implementation PRs
   Decide how to supersede or close the ChatGPT-authored PR #65 after reviewing its reuse in Codex PR #68. Preserve authorship and cherry-pick provenance. Do not blindly merge both branches.

[ ] 04. Independently review Codex PR #68
   Inspect actual code, SQL, test fixtures, task permissions, evidence and changed paths. Verify that its new Phase B work is separately authorized and reviewed, rather than accepting the Codex report alone.

[ ] 05. Verify the database privilege defect
   Run the proposed PostgreSQL 17 regression on an isolated disposable database. Confirm the original books-table privilege behavior and prove that the proposed grant correction removes inappropriate TRUNCATE and other excess privileges.

[ ] 06. Approve the additional privilege-hardening migration
   Obtain an explicit owner decision for the newly proposed third SQL migration. Earlier authorization for the original two migrations does not automatically approve a new one.

[ ] 07. Establish safe hosted migration access
   Authenticate the Supabase CLI securely, verify the exact vellistry-dev target, preserve correct migration versions/history, perform a reviewed dry run and exclude unrelated Vault, roles, seed and reset operations.

[ ] 08. Run authorized hosted development acceptance
   After approval and successful isolated SQL verification, apply the reviewed migrations and test two disposable authors, book persistence, account isolation, forged ownership, RLS and prohibited operations. Clean up fixtures.

[ ] 09. Resolve the signed-out JWT security risk
   Test whether an unexpired access token can still read private data directly through PostgREST after sign-out. Choose and verify a mitigation or explicitly approved security boundary before any real private-manuscript pilot.

[ ] 10. Complete exact-head and merged-main verification
   Only merge reviewed work after applicable checks actually execute. Verify the final merged file tree and rerun or inspect post-merge checks. Record remaining NOT_RUN/BLOCKED conditions accurately.

[ ] 11. Make CURRENT-STATE.md genuinely current
   Create a compact authoritative current snapshot. Move dated detail into historical records without deleting evidence; eliminate obsolete statements presented as current.

[ ] 12. Reconcile repository entrypoints
   Update AGENTS.md, README.md, PROJECT.md, SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md and affected setup documents to reflect merged architecture, hosted Supabase, and the Codex role.

[ ] 13. Separate current truth from historical truth
   Clearly distinguish accepted decisions, active implementation, unmerged proposals, earlier decisions, synthetic results and archived experiments.

[ ] 14. Create one authoritative onboarding entrypoint
   A newly connected agent should be able to locate the current SHA, effective instructions, active tasks, accepted ADRs, security holds and task-specific context without reading the entire archive.

[ ] 15. Repair contradictory approval and gate states
   Reconcile G_DESIGN, G_CODE, G_PRIVATE_PILOT and G_RELEASE with explicit owner-approved individual task exceptions. Approval of one slice must never be misrepresented as global product approval.

[ ] 16. Finish original research-source preservation
   Archive or provide immutable, access-controlled retrieval references for SRC-001 through SRC-004; verify hashes and reference the actual original bytes, not only research summaries.

[ ] 17. Strengthen source-to-requirement traceability
   Keep original user intent, research findings, proposals, accepted requirements, feature IDs and test evidence separate. Fix missing or ambiguous links.

[ ] 18. Maintain ADR lifecycle and supersession
   Reconcile proposed/accepted/implemented states, dated owner approval, alternatives, implementation references and explicit supersession without rewriting historical decisions.

[ ] 19. Reduce documentation duplication
   Keep one canonical location per current fact or contract. Use links and generated indexes rather than copying full explanations into many plans, reports and agent prompts.

[ ] 20. Make formal handoffs the normal coding path
   Require a unique task and ContextPack for consequential coding tasks, plus a traceable ExecutionBundle afterward. PR #68 demonstrates the mechanism; make it standard for future work.

[ ] 21. Prevent task-scope drift
   When new approval extends a task—such as Phase B after the Phase A-only VEL-TASK-0005—record an approved amendment or create a newly pinned task/ContextPack. Never silently reuse the original permission envelope.

[ ] 22. Standardize task acceptance and permissions
   Every task should contain a bounded objective, source revision, dependencies, allowed paths/actions, forbidden operations, positive and negative tests, owner checkpoints and clear completion criteria.

[ ] 23. Make agent identity and code provenance reliable
   Record which tool/model actually performed each action. Preserve original authorship when cherry-picking or adopting code produced by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor or another contributor.

[ ] 24. Enforce branch and worktree isolation
   One assigned executor per task branch, verified starting SHA, preserved local changes, no silent branch takeover and no simultaneous uncontrolled edits to shared files.

[ ] 25. Make ContextPacks immutable and current
   Validate the task blob and source blob hashes against the pinned commit. Generate a new pack when authoritative inputs or permissions change; do not overwrite dispatched historical packs.

[ ] 26. Standardize complete ExecutionBundles
   Require actual commands, exit codes, changed files, environment, exact source/head SHA, test fixtures, security findings, unresolved risks and FACT/INTERPRETATION/PROPOSAL separation.

[ ] 27. Verify genuine agent independence
   Repeat a real implementation handoff in a fresh Codex or alternative-agent session using only the approved task context. PR #68 proves task packaging and execution, but its own report calls the handoff same-session, not independent cold-start verification.

[ ] 28. Prohibit silent implementation-role substitutions
   Direct feature coding by ChatGPT or switching away from Codex should require an explicit task-specific exception. Planning, reviewing and small governance edits can have proportionate policies.

[ ] 29. Add PR-to-task compliance validation
   Automatically check task identity, ContextPack reference, ExecutionBundle reference, evidence fields and required owner checkpoints for qualifying implementation PRs; allow documented low-risk exemptions.

[ ] 30. Check merged-main artifact integrity
   Ensure every accepted PR's required files survive integration. Detect missing tests and artifacts, including zero-test discovery, to prevent recurrence of the 21-file research recovery incident.

[ ] 31. Audit workflow triggers and test coverage
   Ensure implementation, SQL, validator, task, metadata and relevant documentation changes trigger applicable checks. Passing unrelated tests must not mask untested changed surfaces.

[ ] 32. Establish dependable review evidence
   Make exact-head source inspection, focused negative tests, advisory AI/CodeRabbit review where available and owner disposition explicit. A Draft-skipped CodeRabbit result is not an independent review.

[ ] 33. Protect integration against bypass
   Assess branch-protection/ruleset availability on the private repository. Where GitHub plan limits prevent required checks, use documented owner-controlled merge procedures and verification evidence.

[ ] 34. Separate CI failures from infrastructure failures
   Report runner-not-started, account restrictions, unavailable Docker/PostgreSQL, actual failed assertions and missing configuration as distinct conditions. None should be mislabeled PASS.

[ ] 35. Close and reconcile completed or superseded work
   Review paused PR #59 and old Issue #58, continuing Issue #63, outstanding Stage 3 Issue #18, and the newer #65/#66/#68. Close, retain or supersede with accurate links and decisions.

[ ] 36. Apply least-privilege agent permissions
   Limit repository, credential, filesystem, network, paid API, database and deployment access by task. Preserve explicit owner checkpoints for destructive or high-impact operations.

[ ] 37. Strengthen secret and private-data protections
   Keep local .env files ignored; use secret checks and sanitized logs/artifacts. Never store author manuscripts, access tokens or service-role keys in Git handoff packets.

[ ] 38. Test full project recovery from a clean environment
   Clone the repository without prior ChatGPT context, set up the pinned tooling, reconstruct the active project state and execute a synthetic task. Record everything that cannot be recovered.

[ ] 39. Make CI reproducible without unsafe cloud dependencies
   Maintain disposable PostgreSQL/Auth test paths, predictable tool versions, safe fixture cleanup and offline-capable checks. Hosted tests should require their own explicit authorization.

[ ] 40. Link actual implementation to acceptance status
   Map delivered features and test results back to the 149-ID MVP crosswalk. Update PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT_RUN only from observed behavior, not from planning documents.

[ ] 41. Establish repository recovery and backup checks
   Verify that source, evidence, relevant artifacts and migration history can be recovered, including after bad merges or lost agent worktrees. Keep secrets outside backup copies of the knowledge repository.

[ ] 42. Measure agentic workflow effectiveness
   Track compliant handoffs, cold-start success, verification time, escaped defects, context size, review rework, cost and false claims to determine whether the workflow actually improves delivery.

[ ] 43. Delay additional orchestration infrastructure
   Introduce a custom MCP knowledge server, vector search, knowledge graph or automated multi-agent orchestration only if measured retrieval/coordination problems remain after the Git-first workflow is stabilized.

[ ] 44. Enforce agentic role boundaries at task dispatch and repository write time (CRITICAL)
   Prevent ChatGPT, acting as architect/coordinator/reviewer, from directly implementing code or modifying CI/application files just because it has GitHub write access. Require an owner-authorized, uniquely identified task and immutable ContextPack before Codex begins implementation; record the actual executor in the PR and ExecutionBundle. If Codex cannot be dispatched through the available tools, stop at a reviewable handoff and report NOT_STARTED—do not silently become the implementer. Add a documented exception process for explicitly reassigned tasks or narrowly scoped governance edits; verify role compliance during review and with applicable automated PR-to-task checks. Audit prior coordinator-authored implementation work for provenance and any missing handoff evidence.
   Acceptance: a coordinator-only session cannot claim Codex execution or merge-ready implementation; a CI/PR check flags missing authorized task/ContextPack/executor evidence for qualifying changes, and a real Codex handoff is independently verified.
